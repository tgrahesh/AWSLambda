# AWSLambdaFunctions
# LambdaFucntion1 - S3Bucket_LambdaFucntion
# AWS Lambda S3 Object Upload Handler

This AWS Lambda function is designed to respond to S3 object upload events. It logs the details of the uploaded object to CloudWatch Logs. Additionally, you can add your custom logic to process the uploaded object, such as reading, transforming, or moving it to another location.

## Usage

1. **Function Setup**:

   - Create an AWS Lambda function in your AWS account.
   - Configure the function to trigger on S3 object upload events. You can set up this trigger using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

2. **Function Code**:

   - Copy and paste the provided Python code into your Lambda function. Make sure to save the code.

3. **Execution Role**:

   - Ensure that your Lambda function has an execution role with the necessary permissions to read S3 events and write to CloudWatch Logs. You can create a role in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.

4. **Test the Function**:

   - You can test the Lambda function by manually uploading an object to an S3 bucket that is configured to trigger the function. The Lambda function will log the details of the uploaded object to CloudWatch Logs.

5. **Custom Logic**:

   - Customize the function by adding your own logic to process the uploaded object. This can include tasks like data transformation, validation, copying the object to another location, or triggering further actions.

6. **Monitoring**:

   - Use CloudWatch Logs to monitor the logs generated by the Lambda function. You can set up CloudWatch Alarms to be notified of specific events or errors.

## Function Details

- **Event Input**:
  - The function receives an S3 event as input, which contains information about the uploaded object, such as the bucket name and object key.

- **Logging**:
  - The function logs the details of the uploaded object to CloudWatch Logs, making it easy to track and review the events.

- **Custom Logic**:
  - You can extend the function to perform custom actions on the uploaded object. The provided code includes a placeholder for custom logic.

# LambdaFucntion2 - APIGateway_LambdaFucntion
# AWS Lambda Form Data Processor from online JOTFORM and Email Notifier

This AWS Lambda function is designed to process form data and send an email notification using AWS SES (Simple Email Service). It extracts form data from an HTTP POST request from the online JOT form website, processes the data, and sends an email notification.

## Usage

1. **Function Setup**:

   - Create an AWS Lambda function in your AWS account.

2. **Function Code**:

   - Copy and paste the provided Python code into your Lambda function. Make sure to save the code.

3. **Environment Variables**:

   - Set up environment variables for your Lambda function to configure SES and email parameters.
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary AWS access to send emails via SES.
     - `AWS_REGION`: Set this to your AWS region, e.g., `us-east-1`.
     - `SENDER_EMAIL`: The SES verified sender email address.
     - `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`: The recipient's email address.
     
4. **Execution Role**:

   - Ensure that your Lambda function has an execution role with the necessary permissions to send emails using SES. You can create a role in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.

5. **API Gateway (Optional)**:

   - If you intend to trigger this Lambda function via an HTTP POST request, you can set up an API Gateway to route requests to your Lambda function.

6. **Test the Function**:

   - You can test the Lambda function by sending an HTTP POST request with form data to trigger the function. It will process the form data and send an email notification.

## Function Details

- **Event Input**:
  - The function expects an HTTP POST request containing form data in JSON format.

- **Form Data Processing**:
  - The function processes the form data, extracts specific values, and prepares a notification email.

- **Email Sending**:
  - The function uses AWS SES to send an email to the specified recipient with the processed form data.

- **Customization**:
  - You can customize the email subject and message as needed by modifying the `subject` and `message` variables in the code.

## Monitoring

- You can monitor the execution and logs of your Lambda function using CloudWatch Logs and set up alarms to be notified of specific events or errors.
